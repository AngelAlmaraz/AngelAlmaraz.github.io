             I enjoy playing videogames. Amongst my hobbies are flying drones, building stuff, maybe even some drawing.
             I used to be a PS4 gamer, but PC gaming took my heart. I really enjoy the thought of space exploration, and
             quantum portals (probably not a thing).

             I would really enjoy working for NASA, or maybe even GOOGLE or APPLE. But in the event that nothing like that
             happens, a sugar cookie would be nice.

             Playing video games has always been one of my go-to activities, and it's even better if you can play
             them with friends. X-box 360 connoisseur and annoying Reddit user. If you, dear reader, happen to be one of the developers of
             the Marble Blast series, I love you. Has more memories of the events that happened during his Elder Scrolls IV
             Oblivion walkthrough than during his actual years in primary school, overall, pretty cool guy.

             Working for Google, Nintendo, or Elon Musk, as basic as vanilla ice cream.
